            multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 171 countries.His first 
            job was at age 18 as a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and 
            musical instruments before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually worked his 
            way up to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK,"
            which later became a widely known symbol of IBM. Throughout his life, Mr. Watson maintained a deep interest in international 
            relations. He adopted for IBM the slogan, "World Peace Through World Trade," worked closely with the International Chamber of 
            Commerce and in 1937 was elected its president. For many years Mr. Watson served as a trustee of Columbia University and Lafayette 
            College. He was presented with honorary degrees by 27 colleges and universities in the United States and four abroad. 
            Mr. Watson was named chairman in September 1949. A month before his death on June 19, 1956, Mr. Watson handed over the reins
            of the company to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr. Another son, Arthur K. Watson, served as president of IBM World Trade
            Corp., the company's international operations.
