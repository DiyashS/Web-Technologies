            Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows. It was 
            teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, 
            followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the 
            Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy 
            while moving. I usually play it with my friends and it is very fun to play.
